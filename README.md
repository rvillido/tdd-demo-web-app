# TDD demo Web Application
Applying Test Driven Development (TDD) in a typical Web application.

This is an example project demonstrating how to apply TDD in building a Web application. It contains a set of different automated tests to test various parts of the system.

This project will try to answer typical questions like
- How should I test an application running in a Web server?
- My application uses a database. How should I test my app with a database?
- My application connects to other services over REST or SOAP. How should I test REST or SOAP integrations?
- My application doesn't contain any complex logic. Should I still write unit tests to it?
